# Maize Pest Detection and Identification using YOLOv8

## Introduction

The Maize Pest Detection and Identification system leverages YOLOv8, a cutting-edge object detection model, to accurately identify and classify various pests affecting maize plants. YOLOv8 excels in real-time object detection by providing high accuracy and speed, thanks to its advanced architecture. 

**YOLOv8**: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a powerful object detection model that performs end-to-end detection of objects in images. It achieves high performance by simultaneously predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single forward pass through the network. The model gives accuracy of 85%.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model includes 8,359 images of maize pests, categorized into 14 distinct classes:

- Fall armyworm
- Snail
- Weevil
- Grasshopper
- Ants
- Aphids
- Leaf beetle
- Stem borer
- Caterpillar
- Earwig
- Slug
- Red spider
- Corn worm

Each class represents different pests and stages of maize plant growth, enabling the system to detect pests with high precision.
